_
Adele : I didn't notice anything either. But it's still early, we should keep an eye out for any strange behavior.
_
Baptiste :  So, did anyone have any weird dreams last night? Maybe we can get some clues from that.
_
Arthur : I don't trust anyone's dreams. They could be lying or making things up.
_
I agree with Arthur, dreams can be unreliable. We should focus on observing the players' behavior during the day.
_
Arthur : Exactly, Lea. We should pay attention to how everyone interacts and try to pick up on any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.
_
Christina : I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Could you please repeat what you said?
_
Adele : Arthur and Lea are right. We should focus on observing everyone's behavior during the day and look for any inconsistencies or suspicious actions. We can't rely on dreams or hearsay.

I agree with Arthur. We should pay attention to any unusual behavior or inconsistencies in how people are acting. Let's try to gather more information before making any hasty decisions.
_
Adele : We should be careful not to jump to conclusions too quickly. Let's gather more information and observe everyone's behavior before making any accusations.
