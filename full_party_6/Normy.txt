Lea : Lea: Good morning everyone! It's unfortunate that we lost Adele last night. We need to discuss and figure out who the werewolves might be. Any thoughts or suspicions?
_
Baptiste : Baptiste: Good morning, Lea. It's a shame about Adele. As the Seer, I can confirm that Normy was a Werewolf. So we know at least one of the wolves. Any other suspicions or information from anyone else?
_
Lea : Lea: Thank you for sharing that information, Baptiste. That's definitely a valuable piece of information. As for other suspicions, I don't want to accuse anyone without concrete evidence. Let's try to gather more information and hear from others before making any hasty decisions.
_
Baptiste : Baptiste: Absolutely, Lea. It's important to gather more information before making any accusations. Let's hear from everyone else. Normy, do you have anything to say in your defense?
_
Lea : Lea: Normy, it's your chance to speak up and share any information or thoughts you might have. We're all here to listen and consider everyone's perspective.
_
Normy: Uh, well, I don't really have much to say. I'm just a simple villager, you know. I don't really know what's going on.
_
Arthur : Arthur: Normy, your claim of being a simple villager is quite convenient. But we need more than just claims to make informed decisions. We should all be proactive in gathering information and sharing our suspicions.
