GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : No body died last night !
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Baptiste : Alright, everyone! Good morning! It's the first day and we have no deaths to discuss. I think we should start by introducing ourselves and getting to know each other a bit better. Who wants to start?
_
Normy : Hey everyone! I'm Normy, nice to meet you all. It's great that nobody died last night, but we shouldn't let our guard down. We need to be cautious and pay close attention to each other's actions and behavior. Let's use this day to gather information and figure out who might be the werewolves. Any thoughts on where we should start?
_
Baptiste : I agree with Normy, we shouldn't get complacent just because nobody died. We should definitely start by sharing any suspicions or observations we have. Let's try to analyze each other's behavior and see if we can spot any inconsistencies or unusual actions.
_
Arthur : I don't trust anyone here. Everyone could be lying and trying to deceive us. We need to keep a close eye on each other and question everything. Suspicion is our best ally in this game.
_
Baptiste : Arthur, I understand your skepticism, but we also need to be careful not to jump to conclusions too quickly. Accusing everyone without any evidence can create chaos and confusion. Let's try to focus on specific behaviors or actions that seem suspicious and discuss them openly. That way, we can gather more information and make more informed decisions.
_
Christina : I think it's important for us to listen to each other and give everyone a chance to speak. Sometimes, the quieter ones have valuable insights to share. Let's not overlook anyone's perspective and make sure everyone feels heard.
_
Normy : I totally agree with Christina. We shouldn't dismiss anyone's input just because they're not as vocal. Everyone's opinion matters, and we should create a safe space where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts without fear of judgment. Let's encourage open and respectful communication throughout the discussion.
_
Christina : I believe that it's essential for us to consider all possibilities and not jump to conclusions too quickly. We should avoid making hasty judgments based solely on suspicions. Let's gather as much information as possible and analyze it together before making any decisions.
_
Lea : I think it's important for us to stay positive and work together as a team. We have the advantage of being villagers, and if we trust each other and communicate effectively, we can overcome the challenges posed by the werewolves. Let's focus on finding clues and supporting each other rather than accusing and pointing fingers. We're stronger together!
