_
GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : No body died last night !
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Christina : I think we should be cautious and not rush to accuse anyone without solid evidence. Let's hear from everyone before making any decisions.
_
Lea : I agree with Christina. It's important for us to gather information and listen to everyone's perspectives before making any accusations. We should approach this with an open mind.
_
Christina : I think we should also consider the possibility that the werewolves might try to blend in and appear innocent. We shouldn't dismiss anyone's behavior or statements too quickly.
_
Lea : That's a valid point, Christina. We should be mindful of any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies in what people say. It's important to pay attention to details and not jump to conclusions too hastily.
_
Normy : I agree with both Christina and Lea. We should be cautious and gather as much information as possible before accusing anyone. It's important to keep an open mind and consider all possibilities.
_
Adele : I don't know, guys. We have to be careful, but we also can't just sit here and do nothing. We need to find the werewolves before they eliminate all of us.
_
I vote against Adele. She seems too eager to accuse others without solid evidence. We should be cautious and not rush to judgment.
_
Baptiste : I vote against Arthur. It seems like he's trying to divert attention away from himself by accusing Adele. Let's not jump to conclusions without sufficient evidence.
_
I vote against Baptiste. He's trying to shift the blame onto me instead of providing any useful information. We need to be suspicious of those who are quick to deflect and accuse others.
_
GameMaster : Now is time to vote ! Designate the player you want to eliminate.
_
Baptiste : I vote against Arthur.
_
Christina : I vote against Arthur.
_
Adele : I vote against Arthur.
_
Normy : I vote against Arthur.
_
I vote against Baptiste.
_
Lea : I vote against Arthur.
_
GameMaster : You agreed to eliminate Arthur,who was a Villager
_
You were killed by Everyone
