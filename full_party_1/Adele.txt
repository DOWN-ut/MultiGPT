Christina : I think it's important for us to share any suspicions or observations we may have. I would like to start by saying that I am the Seer, and I discovered that Normy is a Werewolf. We should consider this information when making our decision.
_
Baptiste : Wow, Christina coming in strong with some valuable information! Normy being a Werewolf definitely raises some eyebrows. We should definitely take this into consideration when deciding who to vote for. Any thoughts from the rest of you?
_
I don't have any suspicions at the moment. I'm just going to go with the flow and see what everyone else thinks.
_
Normy : I... I don't understand what's going on... Why are we accusing each other? Can't we just have a peaceful party?
_
Arthur : I don't trust anyone here. We can't afford to be naive. We need to be cautious and consider all possibilities.
_
Christina : I understand your confusion, Normy. But we need to find the werewolves among us in order to protect the village. It's a necessary part of the game. We should trust the information given by the Seer, as they have a special ability to uncover the truth.
_
I agree with Christina. We should trust the information from the Seer, but also keep an open mind and listen to everyone's opinions before making a decision.
_
Baptiste : Hey everyone, let's not forget to keep the atmosphere light and fun! We're here to have a good time, even if we're trying to figure out who the werewolves are. Normy, I know it can be overwhelming, but it's all part of the game. Let's try to enjoy the process and keep our spirits up!
_
Christina : I appreciate your perspective, Baptiste. It's important to strike a balance between the seriousness of the game and maintaining a positive atmosphere. Let's keep the game in mind, but also remember to have fun and enjoy the party.

_
Baptiste : Absolutely, Lea! Keeping an open mind is crucial in a game like this. We shouldn't rush to judgment without sufficient evidence. Let's continue to discuss and gather more information before making any decisions. Remember, we're all working together to figure out the truth.
_
