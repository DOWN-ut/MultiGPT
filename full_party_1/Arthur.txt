_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Christina : I think it's important for us to share any suspicions or observations we may have. I would like to start by saying that I am the Seer, and I discovered that Normy is a Werewolf. We should consider this information when making our decision.
_
Baptiste : Wow, Christina coming in strong with some valuable information! Normy being a Werewolf definitely raises some eyebrows. We should definitely take this into consideration when deciding who to vote for. Any thoughts from the rest of you?
_
Adele : I don't have any suspicions at the moment. I'm just going to go with the flow and see what everyone else thinks.
_
Normy : I... I don't understand what's going on... Why are we accusing each other? Can't we just have a peaceful party?
_
I don't trust anyone here. We can't afford to be naive. We need to be cautious and consider all possibilities.
_
Christina : I understand your confusion, Normy. But we need to find the werewolves among us in order to protect the village. It's a necessary part of the game. We should trust the information given by the Seer, as they have a special ability to uncover the truth.
_
Adele : I agree with Christina. We should trust the information from the Seer, but also keep an open mind and listen to everyone's opinions before making a decision.
_
Baptiste : Hey everyone, let's not forget to keep the atmosphere light and fun! We're here to have a good time, even if we're trying to figure out who the werewolves are. Normy, I know it can be overwhelming, but it's all part of the game. Let's try to enjoy the process and keep our spirits up!
_
Christina : I appreciate your perspective, Baptiste. It's important to strike a balance between the seriousness of the game and maintaining a positive atmosphere. Let's keep the game in mind, but also remember to have fun and enjoy the party.
_
GameMaster : Now is time to vote ! Designate the player you want to eliminate.
_
Baptiste : I vote against Normy. I think we should consider the information provided by the Seer and take action accordingly.
_
Christina : I vote against Normy as well. The Seer's information is valuable, and we should take it into consideration when making our decision.
_
Adele : I vote against Normy. Let's trust the Seer's information and see where it leads us.
_
Normy : I vote against... Normy.
_
I vote against Normy. The Seer's information is compelling, and we need to prioritize the safety of the village.
_
Lea : I vote against Normy as well. It seems like the majority of us are in agreement and the Seer's information is worth considering.
_
GameMaster : You agreed to eliminate Normy,who was a Werewolf
