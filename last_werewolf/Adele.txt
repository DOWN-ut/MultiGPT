GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : No body died last night !
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Lea : Good morning everyone.  
Weird night. No one died.  
Maybe the Witch saved someone.  
Baptiste, did you feel anything odd?  
Arthur, Normy, Adele, what about you?  
I have a bad feeling about Baptiste.  
I think we should vote against Baptiste.
_
Baptiste : Whoa, chill.  
I slept fine. No weird noises.  
Lea, why the sudden hate? Don't be dramatic.  
Adele, Arthur, Normy, Christina — what do you think?  
If you want a reason, give one. I'm not getting lynched for vibes.
_
I checked Normy. He's the Witch.  
So he's not a wolf. Don't lynch Baptiste.  
Lea, stop the drama.  
Arthur, Christina, Normy — speak up. I'm not dying for this.
_
Normy : Wow Adele checked me? Okay I'm the Witch.  
Don't lynch Baptiste.  
Lea, stop the drama and chill, you're full of shit.  
Arthur, Christina, what do you say?  
If nobody has proof, we should lynch the loud pusher — Lea.  
Adele, you ok with that?
_
Lea : Hey, chill.  
Don’t lynch me for vibes.  
Adele, how did you check Normy? Say exactly what you saw.  
Normy, if you’re the Witch, did you use a potion last night? Tell us.  
Christina, Arthur, Baptiste — what do you think?  
We need proof before burning someone.
_
I checked Normy last night.  
I saw Witch. That's exactly it.  
Normy, did you use a potion? Say it.  
Lea, cut the bullshit.  
I won't lynch Baptiste.  
If nobody has proof, I'm leaning to lynch Lea.  
Arthur, Christina, Baptiste — speak up.
_
Christina : I slept. Nothing happened to me.  
No proof yet. Don't lynch on vibes.  
Adele, how sure are you about Normy?  
Normy, did you save someone last night?  
Arthur, Baptiste, say something.
_
Arthur : No way I'm trusting this circus.  
Adele, you checked Normy first? Sounds staged. Prove it.  
Normy, claiming Witch on command is sus. Who just says that?  
Lea, stop acting holier than everyone. You're pushing hard. Why?  
Baptiste, neat and calm? That makes me nervous. Say something real.  
Christina, you asleep again? Speak up.  
I'm leaning to lynch Adele. She smells like a fake Seer. Convince me fast.
_
Baptiste : Alright, quick and clear.

Adele, tell us the exact words you saw. Be precise. Was it “Witch” or something else?

Normy, did you use a potion last night? Save someone or not? Say yes/no.

Lea, you accused me with zero proof. That’s weak. Stop the drama or give facts.

Arthur, why do you think Adele is staged? One clear reason.

Christina, what do you say?

I'm leaning to lynch Lea now. She pushed first and has no proof. If Adele gives exact wording, I’ll change my vote. Oh, and I dreamt of pizza, not murder.
_
I saw "Witch" exactly.  
I checked Normy first thing.  
Normy, did you use a potion? Yes or no.  
Lea, stop the bullshit.  
Arthur, accusing me with no proof makes you look wolfy.  
Baptiste, thanks for not lynching me.  
Christina, speak.  
I'm tired. If no proof, vote Lea.
_
Normy : Yes. I used a potion. I saved Baptiste last night.  
Adele saw right. Don’t lynch me.  
Lea, you’re full of shit. Stop pushing with no proof.  
Arthur, your paranoid circus ain’t helping.  
Baptiste, Christina — let’s vote Lea. Adele, you in?
_
Lea : Okay, everyone calm down.  
Thanks Adele and Normy, that info matters.  
If Normy saved Baptiste, someone targeted him last night.  
That’s important. We should focus on that.  
I asked questions, not trying to burn people.  
Arthur, you keep throwing wild accusations. Why?  
Christina, Baptiste, what do you think now?  
We can't lynch me on vibes. Give real proof.
_
Christina : I slept. Nothing.  
Adele, when exactly did you check Normy? Last night or before dawn?  
Normy, what time did you use the potion? Be precise.  
Don't lynch on vibes. I won't vote Lea without proof.  
Arthur, calm down.
