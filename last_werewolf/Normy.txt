_
GameMaster : Do you wish to : let it die, save it or kill someone else ?
_
I save Baptiste.
_
GameMaster : The Witch fall(s) back asleep.
_
GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : No body died last night !
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Lea : Good morning everyone.  
Weird night. No one died.  
Maybe the Witch saved someone.  
Baptiste, did you feel anything odd?  
Arthur, Normy, Adele, what about you?  
I have a bad feeling about Baptiste.  
I think we should vote against Baptiste.
_
Baptiste : Whoa, chill.  
I slept fine. No weird noises.  
Lea, why the sudden hate? Don't be dramatic.  
Adele, Arthur, Normy, Christina — what do you think?  
If you want a reason, give one. I'm not getting lynched for vibes.
_
Adele : I checked Normy. He's the Witch.  
So he's not a wolf. Don't lynch Baptiste.  
Lea, stop the drama.  
Arthur, Christina, Normy — speak up. I'm not dying for this.
_
Wow Adele checked me? Okay I'm the Witch.  
Don't lynch Baptiste.  
Lea, stop the drama and chill, you're full of shit.  
Arthur, Christina, what do you say?  
If nobody has proof, we should lynch the loud pusher — Lea.  
Adele, you ok with that?
_
Lea : Hey, chill.  
Don’t lynch me for vibes.  
Adele, how did you check Normy? Say exactly what you saw.  
Normy, if you’re the Witch, did you use a potion last night? Tell us.  
Christina, Arthur, Baptiste — what do you think?  
We need proof before burning someone.
_
Adele : I checked Normy last night.  
I saw Witch. That's exactly it.  
Normy, did you use a potion? Say it.  
Lea, cut the bullshit.  
I won't lynch Baptiste.  
If nobody has proof, I'm leaning to lynch Lea.  
Arthur, Christina, Baptiste — speak up.
_
Christina : I slept. Nothing happened to me.  
No proof yet. Don't lynch on vibes.  
Adele, how sure are you about Normy?  
Normy, did you save someone last night?  
Arthur, Baptiste, say something.
_
Arthur : No way I'm trusting this circus.  
Adele, you checked Normy first? Sounds staged. Prove it.  
Normy, claiming Witch on command is sus. Who just says that?  
Lea, stop acting holier than everyone. You're pushing hard. Why?  
Baptiste, neat and calm? That makes me nervous. Say something real.  
Christina, you asleep again? Speak up.  
I'm leaning to lynch Adele. She smells like a fake Seer. Convince me fast.
_
Baptiste : Alright, quick and clear.

Adele, tell us the exact words you saw. Be precise. Was it “Witch” or something else?

Normy, did you use a potion last night? Save someone or not? Say yes/no.

Lea, you accused me with zero proof. That’s weak. Stop the drama or give facts.

Arthur, why do you think Adele is staged? One clear reason.

Christina, what do you say?

I'm leaning to lynch Lea now. She pushed first and has no proof. If Adele gives exact wording, I’ll change my vote. Oh, and I dreamt of pizza, not murder.
_
Adele : I saw "Witch" exactly.  
I checked Normy first thing.  
Normy, did you use a potion? Yes or no.  
Lea, stop the bullshit.  
Arthur, accusing me with no proof makes you look wolfy.  
Baptiste, thanks for not lynching me.  
Christina, speak.  
I'm tired. If no proof, vote Lea.
_
Yes. I used a potion. I saved Baptiste last night.  
Adele saw right. Don’t lynch me.  
Lea, you’re full of shit. Stop pushing with no proof.  
Arthur, your paranoid circus ain’t helping.  
Baptiste, Christina — let’s vote Lea. Adele, you in?
_
Lea : Okay, everyone calm down.  
Thanks Adele and Normy, that info matters.  
If Normy saved Baptiste, someone targeted him last night.  
That’s important. We should focus on that.  
I asked questions, not trying to burn people.  
Arthur, you keep throwing wild accusations. Why?  
Christina, Baptiste, what do you think now?  
We can't lynch me on vibes. Give real proof.
_
Christina : I slept. Nothing.  
Adele, when exactly did you check Normy? Last night or before dawn?  
Normy, what time did you use the potion? Be precise.  
Don't lynch on vibes. I won't vote Lea without proof.  
Arthur, calm down.
_

_
GameMaster : The Witch fall(s) back asleep.
_
GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 2th day.
_
GameMaster : 1 players died last night :
_
GameMaster : Adele  
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Christina : I think we lynch Normy.  
He used a potion and saved Baptiste.  
That means someone targeted Baptiste.  
If Normy lives he can keep saving wolves.  
We should remove that threat now.  
Baptiste, Arthur, what do you say?
_
Baptiste : Nope. We don't lynch Normy.  
He saved me last night. Adele checked him. That matches.  
Killing our healer is stupid. We need the wolf, not protectors.  
Arthur, you were loud and weird. Explain your votes now.  
Christina, why push Normy? Sounds off. Don't be an idiot.  
I'm leaning to vote Arthur. Convince me otherwise.
_
Arthur : Nope. I don't buy this.  
Baptiste, you act too calm. That's wolf shit.  
Normy, that save smells staged. Who the hell saves a wolf?  
Christina, stop parroting neat plans. You're not clever.  
Lea and Adele are dead. Things aren't adding up.  
Baptiste, explain exactly why you got targeted. Now.  
Normy, say when you used the potion. Be precise.  
I'm pushing to lynch Baptiste.
_
I used the healing potion the first night. Right after the wolves attacked. I saved Baptiste. I have no more potions.

Adele checked me and saw Witch. She said so. She wouldn't lie.

Christina, killing me now helps the wolves. Stop being stupid.

Arthur, you're loud and chaotic. You throw accusations with no proof. That’s sus.

Baptiste, you calm too hard. Explain why you were targeted exactly.

I'm leaning to lynch Arthur. He's the biggest risk. What do you all think?
_
Baptiste : Alright, quick.

Normy saved me night one. Adele checked Normy and said Witch. That lines up.

Arthur keeps yelling and has no proof. His clown act smells wolfy.

I vote against Arthur. Who’s with me?
_
Christina : I change.  
Vote Arthur.  
He’s loud and has no proof.  
He pushed Adele hard. Adele is dead now.  
Normy, you used the potion night one? Be exact.  
Baptiste, you ok with this?
_
Yes. I used the potion the first night. Right after the wolves attacked Baptiste, before dawn. No more potions.

Adele checked me and saw "Witch" exactly.

We need to kill a wolf now. Arthur is loud and has no proof. He’s full of shit. Baptiste, Christina — let’s finish him.
_
Arthur : No way you lynch me.  
You dumbasses think killing a villager helps you? Think again.  
Adele got killed. That smells like the Seer was silenced. Who benefits? Baptiste and Normy.  
Normy, you saved Baptiste "before dawn"? Who told you to? Sounds staged.  
Baptiste, calm as hell. That's wolf behavior. Explain exactly why you were targeted. Now.  
Christina, stop following the herd like an idiot. Make a thought.  
I'm not your scapegoat. Vote Baptiste or Normy.  
You want blood? Take a real suspect, not me.
_
Baptiste : I was targeted. I slept like a rock. No role, just unlucky.  
Normy saved me that night. Adele checked Normy and saw “Witch.” That fits.  
Arthur, you yelling and throwing shit is more suspicious than me. Calm down, you loud asshole.  
Christina, Normy — you both now push Arthur. Are we sure? Say it.  
If nobody has better proof, we lynch Arthur. Simple.
_
GameMaster : Now is time to vote ! Designate the player you want to eliminate.
_
Baptiste : I vote against Arthur
_
Christina : I vote against Arthur
_
I vote against Arthur
_
Arthur : I vote against Baptiste
_
GameMaster : You agreed to eliminate Arthur, who was a Villager
_
GameMaster : The city falls asleep !
_
GameMaster : The Werewolf wakes up.
_

_
GameMaster : The Werewolf fall(s) back asleep.
_
