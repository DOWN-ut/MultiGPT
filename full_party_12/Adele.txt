_
Normy : Hey everyone, it's the first day and we got lucky that nobody died last night. We should use this opportunity to gather information and discuss who we think might be a werewolf. Personally, I don't have any suspicions yet, but I'm open to hearing what you all have to say. Let's work together to figure this out.
_
Baptiste : Hey Normy, I agree with you. It's good that nobody died, but it also means we don't have any concrete information. We should start by sharing any observations or gut feelings we have about the players. Let's hear from everyone and see if any patterns or suspicions emerge.
_
Christina : I think we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions too quickly. Let's gather more information before accusing someone.
_
Arthur : I understand your point, Christina, but we can't afford to be too cautious either. We need to be proactive and start discussing our suspicions. It's better to be safe than sorry.
_
Baptiste : I agree with Arthur to some extent. We can't afford to be passive and let the werewolves roam freely. However, I also agree with Christina that we need more information before accusing someone. Let's hear from each player and see if anyone has noticed anything unusual or has any suspicions. That way, we can make an informed decision.
_
Normy : Hey Baptiste, I appreciate your balanced approach. It's important to gather information before making any accusations. Let's hear from each player and see if anyone has noticed anything suspicious. Remember, we all need to be honest and open in order to find the werewolves among us.
_
Lea : Hey everyone, I agree with Normy. It's crucial that we all participate and share our observations. We should listen to each other and keep an open mind. Remember, we're all trying to work together to identify the werewolves and protect our village. Let's not let suspicion divide us, but rather use it as a tool to find the truth.
_
I don't have any suspicions yet, but I'll keep an eye out for any unusual behavior. Let's all stay alert and work together to figure this out.
_
Lea : I appreciate your openness, Adele. It's important that we all stay vigilant and observant. Sometimes even the smallest details can help us uncover the truth. Let's continue to share any suspicions or observations we have, and remember to approach this with respect and kindness towards each other. Together, we can find the werewolves and ensure the safety of our village.

_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Baptiste : Hey everyone, it's unfortunate that Normy was killed last night. We need to discuss and figure out who might be responsible for this. Does anyone have any suspicions or observations they'd like to share? Let's work together to find the werewolves among us.
_
Arthur : I have my suspicions about Baptiste. He voted against Christina yesterday, who turned out to be a Seer. It seems too convenient to me. I think we should consider him as a possible werewolf.
_
Baptiste : Come on, Arthur! You're suspecting me just because I voted against Christina? That's a weak argument. We had to vote for someone, and I made my choice based on the information we had at that time. It's unfair to jump to conclusions without more evidence. Let's not be hasty in accusing each other.
_
Lea : I understand your concern, Arthur, but let's not forget that we don't have concrete evidence against Baptiste. Accusing someone solely based on their voting pattern is not enough. We should approach this with an open mind and consider other possibilities as well. It's important that we gather more information and hear from everyone before making any decisions.
_
I don't have any strong suspicions at the moment. It's still early in the game and we don't have much to go on. Let's remember to keep an open mind and listen to each other's perspectives. We should focus on gathering more information before accusing anyone.
_
Lea : I agree with Adele. We should be cautious and not jump to conclusions too quickly. It's important to keep an open mind and continue to gather information. Let's hear from each player and see if anyone has noticed anything unusual or has any new suspicions. We need to work together and approach this with fairness and respect for one another.
