GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : No body died last night !
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Hey everyone, it's the first day and we got lucky that nobody died last night. We should use this opportunity to gather information and discuss who we think might be a werewolf. Personally, I don't have any suspicions yet, but I'm open to hearing what you all have to say. Let's work together to figure this out.
_
Baptiste : Hey Normy, I agree with you. It's good that nobody died, but it also means we don't have any concrete information. We should start by sharing any observations or gut feelings we have about the players. Let's hear from everyone and see if any patterns or suspicions emerge.
_
Christina : I think we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions too quickly. Let's gather more information before accusing someone.
_
Arthur : I understand your point, Christina, but we can't afford to be too cautious either. We need to be proactive and start discussing our suspicions. It's better to be safe than sorry.
_
Baptiste : I agree with Arthur to some extent. We can't afford to be passive and let the werewolves roam freely. However, I also agree with Christina that we need more information before accusing someone. Let's hear from each player and see if anyone has noticed anything unusual or has any suspicions. That way, we can make an informed decision.
_
Hey Baptiste, I appreciate your balanced approach. It's important to gather information before making any accusations. Let's hear from each player and see if anyone has noticed anything suspicious. Remember, we all need to be honest and open in order to find the werewolves among us.
_
Lea : Hey everyone, I agree with Normy. It's crucial that we all participate and share our observations. We should listen to each other and keep an open mind. Remember, we're all trying to work together to identify the werewolves and protect our village. Let's not let suspicion divide us, but rather use it as a tool to find the truth.
_
Adele : I don't have any suspicions yet, but I'll keep an eye out for any unusual behavior. Let's all stay alert and work together to figure this out.
_
Lea : I appreciate your openness, Adele. It's important that we all stay vigilant and observant. Sometimes even the smallest details can help us uncover the truth. Let's continue to share any suspicions or observations we have, and remember to approach this with respect and kindness towards each other. Together, we can find the werewolves and ensure the safety of our village.
