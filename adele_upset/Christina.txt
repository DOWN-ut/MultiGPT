GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : 1 players died last night :
_
GameMaster : Arthur  
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Lea : Oh no, poor Arthur! I didn't expect that. Does anyone have any ideas? I honestly have no clue yet. Maybe we can share if anyone saw something weird?
_
Normy : Huh? Wait, someone died already? Damn. I don’t get this game. Why Arthur though? That’s kinda sus. Anyone got beef with him?
_
Adele : No idea. I just want to go back to sleep. This game is weird. Anyone wanna skip?
_
I checked Baptiste, he’s a villager. I got nothing else. Anyone seem off to you?
_
Adele : I don’t know, everyone looks tired. Christina, you sound too sure. Maybe you’re hiding something.
_
Baptiste : Yo chill, Adele, I’m always tired, but never sus.  
Christina, thanks for clearing my beautiful name.  
Arthur probably died 'cause he always eats the last chips at parties.  
Lea, you look nervous, blink twice if you’re a werewolf.
_
Adele : Baptiste, you talk too much. I just want food, not drama. Nobody here seems trustworthy.
_
Normy : Damn Adele, chill, it’s just a game. I’m lost but Christina saying she’s seer is kinda bold. Or is she just making stuff up?  
Baptiste always talks too much, but that’s just his thing.  
Lea, you got anything to say or just scared of Baptiste’s chips-stealing vibes?
_
Adele : Normy, I don’t trust anyone who claims roles this early. Feels desperate. Everyone’s acting weird, but maybe that’s just how we all are.
_
I get that, Adele. But I had to share, or I’d look shady.  
Normy, you can check me next if you want.  
Lea’s quiet. Makes me nervous.
_
Adele : Yeah, Lea is always too quiet. Quiet people make me nervous too. Maybe she’s just bored like me. Or maybe not.
_
GameMaster : Now is time to vote ! Designate the player you want to eliminate.
_
Baptiste : I vote against Lea
_
I vote against Lea

Adele : I vote against Lea
