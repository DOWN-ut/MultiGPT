GameMaster : 1 players died last night :
_
GameMaster : Christina  
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Lea : Hey everyone! It's a shame that Christina didn't make it through the night. Let's try to figure out who could be responsible for her death. Any thoughts or suspicions?
_
I think we should be suspicious of Baptiste. He was the one who voted against Christina last night.
_
Lea : Hmm, I understand your concern, Arthur. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. It's important to consider all possibilities before accusing someone.
_
Normy : Hey guys, I'm just a simple villager, but I think it's worth considering the possibility that Christina's death could have been the result of a random attack by the werewolves. We shouldn't assume that Baptiste is guilty based solely on his vote. Let's keep an open mind and gather more information before making any accusations.
_
I understand your point, Normy. But we can't ignore the fact that Baptiste was the only one who voted against Christina. It's definitely suspicious and warrants further investigation.
_
Baptiste : Hey, hey, hold on a second! I know my vote may seem suspicious, but let's not forget that I am a werewolf. It's in my nature to target villagers like Christina. But hey, maybe I just wanted to mess with you guys and voted randomly, who knows? Let's not take this game too seriously, right? *winks*
_
Normy : Baptiste, you make a good point about not taking the game too seriously. It's possible that your vote was just a random choice to throw us off. However, we can't ignore the fact that you're a werewolf, and it does raise suspicions. Let's keep an eye on Baptiste, but also consider other possibilities. We shouldn't rush to judgment without more evidence.
_
GameMaster : Now is time to vote ! Designate the player you want to eliminate.
_
Baptiste : I vote against Arthur.
_
Adele : I vote against Arthur.
_
Normy : I vote against Arthur.
_
I vote against Baptiste.
_
Lea : I vote against Arthur.
_
GameMaster : You agreed to eliminate Arthur, who was a Werewolf
