_
Christina :  Good morning everyone. It's unfortunate that we lost Normy and Adele last night. We need to figure out who is responsible for these deaths. Any thoughts on who might be the werewolves?
_
Arthur : I don't trust anyone here. We need to be very careful and not trust anyone blindly.
_
Lea : I understand your concerns, Arthur. It's important to be cautious, but we also can't let suspicion tear us apart. We should try to gather more information before making any accusations.
_
Christina : I agree with Lea. We should try to gather more information before jumping to conclusions. We could start by discussing any suspicious behavior or strange actions that anyone may have noticed during the night.
_
Lea : I haven't noticed anything particularly suspicious during the night. Has anyone else observed anything unusual or have any suspicions about a specific player? Let's share our thoughts and see if we can find any leads.
_
Christina : I haven't noticed anything unusual either. It seems like we don't have much to go on at the moment. We should try to gather more information before making any hasty decisions.
