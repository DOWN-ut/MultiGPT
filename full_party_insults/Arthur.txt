_
GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : No body died last night !
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
No body dead. Bullshit.  
Normy, you silent like a fucking corpse. Speak.  
Baptiste, you yap too much. That’s suspicious.  
Christina, Adele, Lea — don’t hide either. I don’t trust quiet ones.  
Seer could be lying or scared to say shit.  
My gut screams Normy. He’s baiting.  
We push him now and watch reactions.  
If you wanna live, say something real.
_
Adele : Whatever. Normy seems sus.  
Arthur's a loud asshole but maybe right.  
Baptiste yaps too much.  
Christina, Lea — say something.  
I'm tired. I'm leaning Normy.
_
I wanted Baptiste out first.  
You all push Normy now? Fine.  
Normy, speak or I tear you apart with questions.  
Christina, Lea, stop hiding and say something real.  
Adele, lazy bitch, don’t just echo me.  
Everyone’s lying here. I’m not pleased.
_
Lea : I don't want to lynch Normy yet.  
He seemed scared, not sneaky.  
Baptiste talks too much and dodges stuff. That annoys me.  
Arthur, calm down. You're making everyone tense.  
Christina, Adele, what do you think about Baptiste?  
Normy, tell us quickly where you were last night.
_
Normy : What? Me? I slept all night, honest.  
Arthur, calm your shit — you’re a loud asshole.  
Baptiste yaps too much and dodges questions. Smells weird.  
Christina, Adele — you two, speak up.  
Lea, you saw anything?  
Seer, if you checked someone, say it.
_
Baptiste : I checked Arthur last night. He's a villager. Hat's safe, people.

Arthur, chill the screaming. You're not the wolf.

Normy looks nervous as hell. Could be scared or guilty.

Lea — you didn't want to lynch Normy. Why the hesitation?

Adele, Christina — which way are you leaning? Speak up.

If we can't reach a clear choice, I'm leaning Normy. Don't make me eat my shoe next time.
_
Lea : I still don't want to lynch Normy.  
He looked scared, not sneaky.  
Baptiste, you say you checked Arthur — how did you do it?  
Seer, if you checked someone, please say it.  
Arthur, stop shouting and give facts.  
Christina, Adele, what do you think now?
_
Baptiste, you smell like bullshit.  
Only one seer. Prove it. Saying I'm villager is classic protection play.  
Normy, you keep saying "I slept." Where exactly? Alone? Who can back that?  
Adele, stop echoing and actually say why you trust Normy.  
Lea, you soft. Decide. We need votes.  
Christina, shut up and pick a side.  
I’m leaning Normy now because most of you push him. But Baptiste’s claim stinks.  
If we hang Normy and nothing changes, Baptiste’s next.  
Speak up or shut up — we’re wasting time.
_
Baptiste : I used my seer power last night. I checked Arthur. He’s a villager. Hat’s safe.

Arthur, stop yelling like a maniac. You scare people, not solve shit.

Normy, where exactly did you sleep? Alone? Give details now.

Lea, I hear you, but scared people can be wolves too. Adele, Christina — speak up. Which side are you on?

If no one gives facts, I’m leaning Normy. Decide or I push the vote.
_
Normy : I slept alone in my bed. I swear.  
I'm terrified, not sneaky.  
Arthur, shut the hell up, you bully.  
Baptiste, prove your seer or shut it. That smells fake.  
Lea backed me — remember that.  
Christina, Adele — stop hiding and pick a side.  
I'm leaning Baptiste now. Show proof or get lynched.
_
Christina : I don't want to lynch Normy now.  
Baptiste's seer claim smells fake.  
Arthur, stop yelling like an asshole.  
Seer, prove it or stay quiet.  
Let's wait one day and watch reactions.
_
Normy : Fuck, I'm shaking.  
I slept alone, I swear.  
Stop acting like I'm the killer.  
Baptiste, your "seer" smells fake. No proof.  
Arthur, yelling changes nothing. Calm the fuck down.  
Adele, speak up. Don't be lazy.  
Lea, thanks for not lynching me.  
Christina, wait a day if you can. But if we hang someone, hang Baptiste.
_
Adele : I'm tired. I don't wanna lynch now.  
Lea and Christina want to wait, I'm with them.  
Baptiste, prove your seer or shut up.  
Arthur, shut the fuck up — yelling helps nothing.  
Normy, stop freaking out and give a straight answer.  
No vote from me today. We watch.
