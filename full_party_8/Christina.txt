GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : 1 players died last night :
_
GameMaster : Adele  
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Normy : Well, it's unfortunate that Adele was killed last night. We should try to figure out who the werewolves are so we can protect ourselves. Any thoughts on who might be suspicious?
_
I think we should consider Baptiste as a possible suspect. He has been quiet so far and hasn't contributed much to the discussion.
_
Baptiste : I understand your concern, Christina, but being quiet doesn't necessarily make me a werewolf. I've just been listening and trying to gather information. Let's not jump to conclusions too quickly.
_
Lea : I agree with Baptiste. We shouldn't accuse someone based solely on their quietness. Let's give everyone a chance to speak up and share their thoughts before making any judgments.
_
Arthur : I vote against Christina. She was revealed as a werewolf by the Seer. I don't trust her.
_
I understand your suspicion, Arthur, but I believe we should be cautious about trusting the Seer's information completely. They could have been deceived or mistaken. Let's not rush into accusing someone without more evidence.
_
Normy : I think it's important to consider all perspectives and gather more information before making any accusations. It's possible that the Seer made a mistake or that someone is pretending to be innocent. Let's keep an open mind and continue the discussion.
_
GameMaster : Now is time to vote ! Designate the player you want to eliminate.
_
Baptiste : I vote against Christina.
_
I vote against Arthur.
_
Normy : I vote against Christina.
_
Arthur : I vote against Christina.
_
Lea : I vote against Christina.
_
GameMaster : You agreed to eliminate Christina, who was a Werewolf
_
You were killed by Everyone
