GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : No body died last night !
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Adele :  So, nobody died last night. That's a relief, I guess. But it also means we still have the werewolves among us.
_
Christina : I think we should be cautious and consider all possibilities.
_
Lea : I agree with Christina. We can't rule out the possibility of the werewolves trying to blend in and appear innocent. We need to be vigilant and analyze everyone's behavior.
_
I don't trust anyone here. We should be suspicious of everyone until proven otherwise.
_
Baptiste : Hey everyone, let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. We should definitely be cautious, but we also need to give each other a fair chance to prove our innocence. Remember, we're all here to have fun and enjoy the game!
_
Adele : I guess you're right, Baptiste. We shouldn't accuse anyone without solid evidence. But let's also keep an eye out for any suspicious behavior.
_
Christina : I think it's important for us to communicate openly and share any suspicions or observations we have. That way, we can collectively gather information and make more informed decisions.
_
Normy : I agree with Christina. Open communication is key in this game. Let's share our thoughts and observations so we can work together to find the werewolves.
_
Christina : I think we should also consider the role of the Seer. If the Seer has any information about the identities of the werewolves, they should come forward and share it with the group. It could greatly help us in making our decisions.
_
GameMaster : Now is time to vote ! Designate the player you want to eliminate.
_
Baptiste : I vote against Normy.
_
Christina : I vote against Normy.

Adele : I vote against Normy.
