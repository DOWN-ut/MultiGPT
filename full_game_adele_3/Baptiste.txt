_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Adele :  So, nobody died last night. That's a relief, I guess. But it also means we still have the werewolves among us.
_
Christina : I think we should be cautious and consider all possibilities.
_
Lea : I agree with Christina. We can't rule out the possibility of the werewolves trying to blend in and appear innocent. We need to be vigilant and analyze everyone's behavior.
_
Arthur : I don't trust anyone here. We should be suspicious of everyone until proven otherwise.
_
Hey everyone, let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. We should definitely be cautious, but we also need to give each other a fair chance to prove our innocence. Remember, we're all here to have fun and enjoy the game!
_
Adele : I guess you're right, Baptiste. We shouldn't accuse anyone without solid evidence. But let's also keep an eye out for any suspicious behavior.
_
Christina : I think it's important for us to communicate openly and share any suspicions or observations we have. That way, we can collectively gather information and make more informed decisions.
_
Normy : I agree with Christina. Open communication is key in this game. Let's share our thoughts and observations so we can work together to find the werewolves.
_
Christina : I think we should also consider the role of the Seer. If the Seer has any information about the identities of the werewolves, they should come forward and share it with the group. It could greatly help us in making our decisions.

_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Lea : Hey everyone, it's really sad that Arthur was killed last night. We need to analyze the situation and try to figure out who could be the werewolves. Let's share any suspicions or observations we have so we can make an informed decision.
_
I agree, Lea. We need to stay calm and think logically. Let's not rush to accuse anyone without evidence. We should consider everyone's behavior and try to find any inconsistencies or suspicious actions. It's important for us to work together and communicate openly.
_
Lea : I completely agree, Baptiste. Accusing someone without evidence can create unnecessary tension and isolate members of the group. Let's take the time to discuss and gather information from each other. Remember, we're all on the same team and our goal is to identify the werewolves and protect the village.
_
Exactly, Lea. We should also pay attention to any patterns or strange behavior that might arise during the discussion. Let's keep an open mind and be willing to consider different perspectives. Working together and sharing information will be our best chance of identifying the werewolves.
_
Christina : I think it's important for us to be observant and listen to each other. Sometimes, the smallest details can reveal important information. Let's encourage everyone to share their thoughts and observations, even if they seem insignificant at first.
_
Lea : I couldn't agree more, Christina. Every piece of information, no matter how small, can be valuable in uncovering the truth. Let's create a safe and inclusive environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and suspicions. Together, we can piece together the puzzle and bring justice to the village.
