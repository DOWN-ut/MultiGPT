GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : No body died last night !
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Hey everyone! Good morning! It's great that nobody died last night, that means we're off to a good start. I think we should use this opportunity to get to know each other better and share any suspicions or observations we may have. Let's work together to find the werewolves among us!
_
Arthur : I don't trust anyone here. We can't be too sure that no one is lying about last night. We should still be cautious.
_
Arthur, I understand your concern, but let's try to remain positive and open-minded. Accusing others without any evidence can create unnecessary tension. Let's focus on gathering information and discussing our suspicions in a respectful manner. We should give everyone a chance to speak up before making any hasty judgments.
_
Christina : I agree with Lea. It's important for us to approach this game with an open mind and listen to what everyone has to say. Let's encourage each other to share any information or suspicions we may have, but let's also be cautious about jumping to conclusions without solid evidence.
_
Arthur : I understand what you're saying, but I still think we should be skeptical of everyone's words. People can easily lie and deceive us. We should keep a close eye on any suspicious behavior and not blindly trust anyone.
_
Arthur, I understand your skepticism, but we shouldn't let it consume us. It's true that people can lie in this game, but we also need to give everyone a fair chance. Accusing someone without any evidence can create unnecessary conflict. Let's focus on observing everyone's behavior and gathering information before making any judgments. We're in this together, so let's work as a team and support each other.
_
Arthur : I still believe we should be cautious and not fully trust anyone. We need to analyze everyone's actions and words. It's better to be safe than sorry.
_
Arthur, I understand your concern and I agree that it's important to analyze everyone's actions and words. However, we also need to strike a balance between caution and trust. Being too suspicious of everyone can create an atmosphere of distrust and hinder our ability to work together. Let's keep an open mind and encourage honest communication. As the game progresses, we'll have more information to make informed decisions.
_
Christina : I think Lea makes a valid point. It's important to find a balance between caution and trust. We should be observant and take note of any suspicious behavior, but also give each other the benefit of the doubt until we have concrete evidence. Let's continue to communicate and work together to uncover the truth.
