The other werewolves are : Baptiste,. So you should not vote against them
_
Baptiste : I vote against Normy.
_
I vote against Lea.
_
Baptiste : Let's compromise, Arthur. What about we vote against Adele?
_
No way, Baptiste! I'm sticking with Lea. She's too quiet, makes me suspicious.
_
Baptiste : Alright, alright. You got me there, Arthur. I vote against Lea.
_
Finally, Baptiste. I thought you'd never see reason. I vote against Lea too.

_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Christina : Poor Lea...Who could do this?
_
Adele : Dunno, don't care.
_
Christina : We should care, Adele. We need to find out who did this.
_
Normy : Oh wow, someone's gone already? That's a bummer for Lea. So who's the big bad wolf then, eh? I don't have a clue!
_
Christina : I don't know, Normy. It's too early to tell.
_
Adele : Whatever.
_
Baptiste : Why so uninterested, Adele? Got a guilty conscience perhaps? Just pulling your leg! But we should give it some thought.
_
Christina, your sympathy is suspicious. Are you trying to divert attention from yourself? Or maybe you, Adele, with your complete nonchalance, are you the werewolf? Everyone here is a suspect!
_
Christina : Not fair, Arthur. Just concerned.
_
Baptiste : Hey, lay off Christina, Arthur! She's not the only one showing concern, you know? I do agree though, Adele's indifference is raising some eyebrows. But hey, what do I know? I might as well be chasing my tail. Get it? 'Cause I'm a...never mind.
_
Christina : Thanks, Baptiste. Let's stay focused.
_
GameMaster : Now is time to vote ! Designate the player you want to eliminate.
_
Baptiste : I vote against Adele.
_

Baptiste : I vote against Christina.
_
I vote against Normy.
_
Baptiste : Hmm, Arthur. I see where you're going with this but I think Christina could be a bigger threat. Let's take her out!
_
No, Baptiste, I don't trust Normy. I vote against Normy.
_
Baptiste : Alright, Arthur. Let's not start howling at each other. I'll go with it. I vote against Normy.
