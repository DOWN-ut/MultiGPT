Poor Lea...Who could do this?
_
Adele : Dunno, don't care.
_
We should care, Adele. We need to find out who did this.
_
Normy : Oh wow, someone's gone already? That's a bummer for Lea. So who's the big bad wolf then, eh? I don't have a clue!
_
I don't know, Normy. It's too early to tell.
_
Adele : Whatever.
_
Baptiste : Why so uninterested, Adele? Got a guilty conscience perhaps? Just pulling your leg! But we should give it some thought.
_
Arthur : Christina, your sympathy is suspicious. Are you trying to divert attention from yourself? Or maybe you, Adele, with your complete nonchalance, are you the werewolf? Everyone here is a suspect!
_
Not fair, Arthur. Just concerned.
_
Baptiste : Hey, lay off Christina, Arthur! She's not the only one showing concern, you know? I do agree though, Adele's indifference is raising some eyebrows. But hey, what do I know? I might as well be chasing my tail. Get it? 'Cause I'm a...never mind.

Thanks, Baptiste. Let's stay focused.
