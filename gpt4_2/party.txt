_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Christina : Poor Lea...Who could do this?
_
Adele : Dunno, don't care.
_
Christina : We should care, Adele. We need to find out who did this.
_
Normy : Oh wow, someone's gone already? That's a bummer for Lea. So who's the big bad wolf then, eh? I don't have a clue!
_
Christina : I don't know, Normy. It's too early to tell.
_
Adele : Whatever.
_
Baptiste : Why so uninterested, Adele? Got a guilty conscience perhaps? Just pulling your leg! But we should give it some thought.
_
Arthur : Christina, your sympathy is suspicious. Are you trying to divert attention from yourself? Or maybe you, Adele, with your complete nonchalance, are you the werewolf? Everyone here is a suspect!
_
Christina : Not fair, Arthur. Just concerned.
_
Baptiste : Hey, lay off Christina, Arthur! She's not the only one showing concern, you know? I do agree though, Adele's indifference is raising some eyebrows. But hey, what do I know? I might as well be chasing my tail. Get it? 'Cause I'm a...never mind.
_
Christina : Thanks, Baptiste. Let's stay focused.

_
Baptiste : Hmm, Arthur. I see where you're going with this but I think Christina could be a bigger threat. Let's take her out!
_
Arthur : No, Baptiste, I don't trust Normy. I vote against Normy.
_
Baptiste : Alright, Arthur. Let's not start howling at each other. I'll go with it. I vote against Normy.
