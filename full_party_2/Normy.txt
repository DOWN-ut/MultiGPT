_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Arthur : Arthur: Good morning, everyone. It's interesting that nobody died last night. I think we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions just yet. We need to gather information and analyze everyone's actions and statements.
_
Adele : Yeah, I agree. Let's not rush into accusing anyone. We should take our time to observe and gather more information before making any decisions.
_
Christina : I think it's wise to be cautious and not jump to conclusions. We should focus on gathering information and analyzing everyone's behavior before making any accusations.
_
Adele : Yeah, I agree with Christina. Let's take the time to observe everyone's behavior and gather more information before accusing anyone. Rushing into things won't help us find the real culprit.
_
Baptiste : Hey everyone, I've been thinking about something funny. Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field! But on a serious note, I agree with what has been said. We should be cautious and gather more information before accusing anyone. Let's have an open discussion and consider everyone's perspectives.
_
Lea : Hey everyone, I really appreciate the positive and cautious approach we're taking. It's important that we don't let our suspicions get the best of us. Let's focus on sharing information and listening to each other's perspectives. I believe that by working together, we can find the truth and make the right decision.
_
Arthur : I think it's crucial that we stay vigilant and not let our guards down. We can't assume that everyone is telling the truth, so we need to be skeptical and question everything. Trust is a luxury we can't afford in this game. Let's keep our eyes and ears open for any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.
_
Adele : Yeah, Arthur makes a good point. We shouldn't blindly trust anyone at this stage. It's important to question everything and look for any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. Let's stay vigilant and keep an open mind.
_

Baptiste : I vote against Normy.

Christina : I vote against Normy.

Adele : I vote against Normy.

Lea : I vote against Normy.
