Christina : I think we should start by discussing our suspicions. Does anyone have any thoughts on who might be a werewolf?

Arthur : I don't trust anyone here. Everyone could be a werewolf.
_
Lea : I think it's important that we approach this with an open mind and not jump to conclusions. Let's hear everyone's thoughts before making any accusations.

Arthur : I don't believe anyone's thoughts are worth hearing. We can't trust what they say.
_
Normy : I agree with Lea. It's important to hear everyone's thoughts before making any judgments. We shouldn't dismiss anyone's opinions without giving them a fair chance.
_
Baptiste : Well, I think it's important to keep an open mind and consider all possibilities. It's true that we can't fully trust anyone, but we can analyze their behaviors and statements to gather some clues. Let's hear what everyone has to say and try to piece together the puzzle.

Normy : I agree with Christina. We shouldn't let our suspicions blind us, but instead, we should focus on gathering more evidence before making any accusations. Let's take a rational approach and analyze the information we have.

_

Because they make up everything! *laughs* Okay, now back to the discussion.
