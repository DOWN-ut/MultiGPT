_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Christina : I think we should start by discussing our suspicions. Does anyone have any thoughts on who might be a werewolf?
_
I don't trust anyone here. Everyone could be a werewolf.
_
Lea : I think it's important that we approach this with an open mind and not jump to conclusions. Let's hear everyone's thoughts before making any accusations.
_
I don't believe anyone's thoughts are worth hearing. We can't trust what they say.
_
Normy : I agree with Lea. It's important to hear everyone's thoughts before making any judgments. We shouldn't dismiss anyone's opinions without giving them a fair chance.
_
Baptiste : Well, I think it's important to keep an open mind and consider all possibilities. It's true that we can't fully trust anyone, but we can analyze their behaviors and statements to gather some clues. Let's hear what everyone has to say and try to piece together the puzzle.
_
Christina : I think it's important for us to keep a level-headed approach and not let our suspicions cloud our judgment. We should carefully consider the information we have and look for any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. Let's focus on gathering more evidence before accusing anyone.
_
Normy : I agree with Christina. We shouldn't let our suspicions blind us, but instead, we should focus on gathering more evidence before making any accusations. Let's take a rational approach and analyze the information we have.
_
Christina : Yes, I think it's crucial for us to gather as much information as possible. We can ask each other questions and share any observations we've made. Let's try to piece together the puzzle and make an informed decision based on evidence, rather than just relying on gut feelings.
_
