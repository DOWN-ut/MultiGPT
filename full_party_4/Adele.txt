_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Arthur : I think we should start by discussing if anyone has any suspicions or information about the werewolves.
_
Lea : I don't have any specific suspicions yet, but I think we should all share any information we have. Communication is important to figure out who the werewolves might be.
_
Arthur : I don't trust anyone here. We should all be cautious and not blindly trust each other's words. Suspicion is our best defense.
_
Lea : I understand your concerns, Arthur. It's important to be cautious, but we also need to create an atmosphere of trust and cooperation. Accusing each other without evidence can lead to misunderstandings and division among us. Let's try to gather more information before making any accusations.
_
Normy : I agree with Lea. We should focus on gathering information and discussing our observations rather than jumping to conclusions. It's important to keep an open mind and consider different perspectives.
_
Arthur : I still believe that we shouldn't trust anyone too easily. We need to be skeptical and question everything. It's better to be safe than sorry.
_
Lea : I understand your point, Arthur. It's important to approach the game with a healthy level of skepticism. However, we should also keep in mind that accusations without evidence can create unnecessary tension and suspicion among us. Let's focus on sharing our observations and discussing any suspicious behavior we've noticed. Together, we can gather more information and make informed decisions.
_
Baptiste : Baptiste: Hey everyone, let's not forget to have some fun too! It's just a game after all. How about we lighten the mood with a joke? Why did the werewolf go to the doctor? Because he was howling with pain!
_
Arthur : We shouldn't let jokes distract us from the seriousness of the situation. We need to stay focused and vigilant in identifying the werewolves among us. Jokes won't help us find the truth.

_
Lea : I think we should discuss our observations and suspicions from the previous day. We need to share any information we have in order to make an informed decision. Let's not rush into accusations, but also be mindful of any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies.
_
I agree with Lea. We should take the time to gather information and discuss our observations before making any hasty decisions. It's important to consider all perspectives and be open to different possibilities.
_
Lea : Thank you for your agreement, Adele. It's crucial for us to approach this situation with patience and thoroughness. Let's hear from everyone and see if anyone has noticed anything suspicious or has any valuable information to share. Remember, our goal is to work together and find the werewolves among us.
_
Normy : I've been thinking about our previous discussions and observations, and I have a suspicion. I noticed that Baptiste has been relatively quiet and hasn't contributed much to the conversation. It could be a strategy to avoid suspicion, but it's something worth considering.
_
Lea : Normy, your observation is valid. However, I believe it's important for us to be cautious in accusing others based solely on their level of participation. Some players may have a more reserved personality or may be taking a more passive approach to the game. Let's try to gather more concrete evidence before jumping to conclusions.
_
Normy : You're right, Lea. It's important not to jump to conclusions based solely on someone's level of participation. I apologize for my hasty suspicion. Let's focus on gathering more information and discussing any suspicious behavior or patterns we've noticed.
