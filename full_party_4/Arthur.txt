_

_
GameMaster : The Witch fall(s) back asleep.
_
GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : No body died last night !
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
I think we should start by discussing if anyone has any suspicions or information about the werewolves.
_
Lea : I don't have any specific suspicions yet, but I think we should all share any information we have. Communication is important to figure out who the werewolves might be.
_
I don't trust anyone here. We should all be cautious and not blindly trust each other's words. Suspicion is our best defense.
_
Lea : I understand your concerns, Arthur. It's important to be cautious, but we also need to create an atmosphere of trust and cooperation. Accusing each other without evidence can lead to misunderstandings and division among us. Let's try to gather more information before making any accusations.
_
Normy : I agree with Lea. We should focus on gathering information and discussing our observations rather than jumping to conclusions. It's important to keep an open mind and consider different perspectives.
_
I still believe that we shouldn't trust anyone too easily. We need to be skeptical and question everything. It's better to be safe than sorry.
_
Lea : I understand your point, Arthur. It's important to approach the game with a healthy level of skepticism. However, we should also keep in mind that accusations without evidence can create unnecessary tension and suspicion among us. Let's focus on sharing our observations and discussing any suspicious behavior we've noticed. Together, we can gather more information and make informed decisions.
_
Baptiste : Baptiste: Hey everyone, let's not forget to have some fun too! It's just a game after all. How about we lighten the mood with a joke? Why did the werewolf go to the doctor? Because he was howling with pain!
_
We shouldn't let jokes distract us from the seriousness of the situation. We need to stay focused and vigilant in identifying the werewolves among us. Jokes won't help us find the truth.
_
GameMaster : Now is time to vote ! Designate the player you want to eliminate.
_
Baptiste : I vote against Arthur.
_
Christina : I vote against Arthur.
_
Adele : I vote against Arthur.
_
Normy : I vote against Arthur.
_
I vote against Christina.
_
Lea : I vote against Arthur.
_
GameMaster : You agreed to eliminate Arthur,who was a Villager
_
You were killed by Everyone
