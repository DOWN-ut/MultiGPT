Lea : Lea: Good morning, everyone! It's great to see that nobody died last night. I think we should use this opportunity to gather information and discuss our suspicions.
_
Arthur: Good morning, Lea. While it's fortunate that nobody died last night, we shouldn't let our guard down. We still need to be vigilant and keep an eye out for any suspicious behavior.
_
Lea : Lea: You're absolutely right, Arthur. We can't afford to become complacent. We should all share our thoughts and observations to uncover any clues that might help us identify the werewolves among us.
_
Baptiste : Baptiste: Good morning, everyone! I hope you all had a restful night. Let's start by sharing any suspicions or odd behaviors that stood out to us yesterday.
_
Lea : Lea: Good morning, Baptiste! I agree, sharing our suspicions will help us piece together the puzzle. Personally, I didn't notice anything particularly suspicious yesterday, but I'm eager to hear what others have to say.
_
Baptiste : Baptiste: Well, Lea, I have a feeling that Adele might be hiding something. She seemed a bit too quiet during our previous discussions. It could be just a hunch, but I think it's worth considering. What do you all think?
_
Adele : Adele: Oh great, now I'm under suspicion. Just what I needed.
_
Lea : Lea: Adele, I understand that being suspected can be uncomfortable, but we're just trying to gather information here. It doesn't mean we're accusing you. We're all in this together and we need to consider everyone's perspectives. Let's remain calm and open-minded while we discuss.

_
Arthur: Good morning, Normy. It's definitely a difficult situation we're in. We need to prioritize finding the werewolves among us. Let's focus on any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies in people's actions. We can't afford to trust blindly.
_
Normy : Normy: You're right, Arthur. Trust should be earned, especially in a game like this. We should pay attention to any inconsistencies or contradictions in people's statements or behavior. It's important to gather as much information as we can before making any hasty decisions.
_
Arthur: Normy, I agree. We should also be cautious of those who try to divert attention or manipulate the conversation. Let's not be afraid to question each other and dig deeper into any suspicious actions or claims. We need to be thorough in our analysis to ensure we make the right decisions.
