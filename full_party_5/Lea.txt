_
Lea: Good morning, everyone! It's great to see that nobody died last night. I think we should use this opportunity to gather information and discuss our suspicions.
_
Arthur : Arthur: Good morning, Lea. While it's fortunate that nobody died last night, we shouldn't let our guard down. We still need to be vigilant and keep an eye out for any suspicious behavior.
_
Lea: You're absolutely right, Arthur. We can't afford to become complacent. We should all share our thoughts and observations to uncover any clues that might help us identify the werewolves among us.
_
Baptiste : Baptiste: Good morning, everyone! I hope you all had a restful night. Let's start by sharing any suspicions or odd behaviors that stood out to us yesterday.
_
Lea: Good morning, Baptiste! I agree, sharing our suspicions will help us piece together the puzzle. Personally, I didn't notice anything particularly suspicious yesterday, but I'm eager to hear what others have to say.
_
Baptiste : Baptiste: Well, Lea, I have a feeling that Adele might be hiding something. She seemed a bit too quiet during our previous discussions. It could be just a hunch, but I think it's worth considering. What do you all think?
_
Adele : Adele: Oh great, now I'm under suspicion. Just what I needed.
_
Lea: Adele, I understand that being suspected can be uncomfortable, but we're just trying to gather information here. It doesn't mean we're accusing you. We're all in this together and we need to consider everyone's perspectives. Let's remain calm and open-minded while we discuss.
_
Adele : Adele: Fine, let's discuss. But I don't have any suspicions myself. I'm just trying to survive this game like the rest of you.
