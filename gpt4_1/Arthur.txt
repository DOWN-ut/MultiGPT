GameMaster : The city falls asleep !

GameMaster : The Seer wakes up.
_
GameMaster : Seer, please tell me the name of the player you would like to know the role
_
GameMaster : The Seer fall(s) back asleep.
_
GameMaster : The Werewolf wakes up.
_
GameMaster : Werewolves, please choose and agree on the name of the player you want to kill tonight
_
GameMaster : The Werewolf fall(s) back asleep.
_
GameMaster : The Witch wakes up.
_
GameMaster : Witch, the victim is: Arthur
_
GameMaster : Do you wish to : let it die, save it or kill someone else ?
_
GameMaster : The Witch fall(s) back asleep.
_
GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : No body died last night !
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Christina : Arthur being saved is suspicious.
_
Normy : Hmm, you think so? I thought it was more of a lucky break, really.
_
Baptiste : I agree with Christina. Seems Arthur has a guardian angel, or he's trying to play us. I mean, come on, what are the odds?
_
Christina : Exactly, too convenient.
_
Adele : Maybe the Witch just wanted to keep everyone alive. No big deal.
_
Christina : Perhaps, but we can't be naive.
_
Yeah, sure, all of you just gang up on me. Classic. You're all probably lying. Nothing convenient about it. I bet one of you is a werewolf trying to throw shade my way.
_
Baptiste : Oh, Arthur, it's not about ganging up. It's about strategy. Don't take it personally. But hey, if it was me, I'd just say thank you to the Witch and maybe crack a joke about it. You know, something like "I guess I'm just too handsome to die." Lighten up, mate.
_
Normy : Oh, is that how it works, Baptiste? I'll try to remember that one. You're right, gotta keep the mood light, haha.
_
GameMaster : Now is time to vote ! Designate the player you want to eliminate.
_
Baptiste : I vote against Arthur.
_
Christina : I vote against Arthur.
_
Adele : I vote against Arthur.
_
Normy : I vote against Baptiste.
_
I vote against Baptiste.
_
Lea : I vote against Baptiste.
_
GameMaster : You agreed to eliminate Arthur, who was a Villager
_
You were killed by Everyone
