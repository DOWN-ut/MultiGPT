GameMaster : No body died last night !
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Christina : Arthur being saved is suspicious.
_
Normy : Hmm, you think so? I thought it was more of a lucky break, really.
_
Baptiste : I agree with Christina. Seems Arthur has a guardian angel, or he's trying to play us. I mean, come on, what are the odds?
_
Christina : Exactly, too convenient.
_
Adele : Maybe the Witch just wanted to keep everyone alive. No big deal.
_
Christina : Perhaps, but we can't be naive.
_
Arthur : Yeah, sure, all of you just gang up on me. Classic. You're all probably lying. Nothing convenient about it. I bet one of you is a werewolf trying to throw shade my way.
_
Baptiste : Oh, Arthur, it's not about ganging up. It's about strategy. Don't take it personally. But hey, if it was me, I'd just say thank you to the Witch and maybe crack a joke about it. You know, something like "I guess I'm just too handsome to die." Lighten up, mate.
_
Normy : Oh, is that how it works, Baptiste? I'll try to remember that one. You're right, gotta keep the mood light, haha.

_
GameMaster : Lea  
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Normy : Poor Lea, she didn't see it coming. Now, I'm just throwing this out there, but don't you think Christina acted a bit strangely yesterday? Just saying.
_
Adele : I guess she did. It's hard to tell who's acting weird and who's just scared though.
_
Christina : Scared? More like cautious.
_
Adele : Yeah, whatever. Doesn't really matter.
_
Baptiste : I've got a hunch about Normy. Always playing the innocent one, aren't you, Normy? Just like a wolf in sheep's clothing... or should I say, like a Normy in a Normy's clothing? No? Too early for bad jokes? Okay, I'll see myself out.
_
Normy : Oh Baptiste, you got me there! I'm just a simple Normy in a Normy's clothing, haha. I wish I was as clever as you.
_
GameMaster : Now is time to vote ! Designate the player you want to eliminate.
