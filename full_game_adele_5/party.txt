GameMaster : 1 players died last night :

_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Normy :  Alright, folks, it looks like we lost Christina last night. We need to figure out who could be behind this. Any ideas or suspicions?
_
Baptiste :  Well, it's a shame we lost Christina, she was a great player. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We should gather any information or clues we have and try to piece it together. Any thoughts from you guys?
_
Arthur : I don't trust anyone here. I think everyone is lying and trying to deceive us. We should be suspicious of everyone.
_
Baptiste :  Oh, come on Arthur, that's a bit extreme! We can't just assume everyone is lying. Let's try to approach this with a bit more rationality. We should focus on gathering information and discussing our observations. Jumping to conclusions won't help us find the real culprit.
_
Arthur : I understand your point, Baptiste, but I've been burned before by trusting too easily. I think it's better to be cautious and question everything. We can't afford to be naive in this game.
_
Normy :  I see both of your perspectives, Baptiste and Arthur. While it's important to gather information, we also need to keep an open mind and not let our suspicions cloud our judgment. We should consider everyone's actions and statements, but let's not accuse anyone without solid evidence. It's still early in the game, so let's keep observing and discussing before making any hasty decisions.
_
Arthur : I disagree, Normy. We can't afford to wait and watch. We need to take action and vote against someone. I have my suspicions and I think it's time to voice them.
_
GameMaster : Now is time to vote ! Designate the player you want to eliminate.

_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Adele : Alright, guys, it's good news that no one died last night. But that doesn't mean we can let our guard down. We still need to figure out who could be the werewolves. Any thoughts or suspicions?
_
Baptiste :  Well, it's a relief that nobody died, but we can't afford to be complacent. We should continue gathering information and discussing our observations. Let's keep an open mind and try to piece together any clues we have. Any ideas from the rest of you?
_
Normy :  I agree with Baptiste, we can't let our guard down just because no one died last night. We should stay vigilant and look for any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies in people's actions. It's important for everyone to share their thoughts and observations so we can make an informed decision. Let's keep the discussion going and try to find the werewolves among us.
_
Baptiste :  Absolutely, Normy! We need everyone's input to make the best decision. Remember, we're all in this together, and we have to work as a team to uncover the truth. So, let's keep sharing our thoughts and observations, and let's not be afraid to question each other. It's the only way we'll find the werewolves and protect our village.
_
Normy :  That's right, Baptiste. We need to trust each other and work together to solve this mystery. It's important to keep an open mind and consider all possibilities. Let's not rush into accusations without solid evidence. Instead, let's focus on gathering more information and discussing our suspicions. We're getting closer to finding the werewolves, so let's stay united and make the right decision.
_
Baptiste :  Well said, Normy! Trust and unity are key in this game. Let's continue to listen to each other's perspectives and analyze the information we have. Remember, we're all villagers, and our goal is to identify and eliminate the werewolves. We can do this together, one step at a time. So let's keep the conversation going and work towards finding the truth.
