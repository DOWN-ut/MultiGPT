GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : 1 players died last night :
_
GameMaster : Christina  
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Normy :  Alright, folks, it looks like we lost Christina last night. We need to figure out who could be behind this. Any ideas or suspicions?
_
Baptiste :  Well, it's a shame we lost Christina, she was a great player. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We should gather any information or clues we have and try to piece it together. Any thoughts from you guys?
_
I don't trust anyone here. I think everyone is lying and trying to deceive us. We should be suspicious of everyone.
_
Baptiste :  Oh, come on Arthur, that's a bit extreme! We can't just assume everyone is lying. Let's try to approach this with a bit more rationality. We should focus on gathering information and discussing our observations. Jumping to conclusions won't help us find the real culprit.
_
I understand your point, Baptiste, but I've been burned before by trusting too easily. I think it's better to be cautious and question everything. We can't afford to be naive in this game.
_
Normy :  I see both of your perspectives, Baptiste and Arthur. While it's important to gather information, we also need to keep an open mind and not let our suspicions cloud our judgment. We should consider everyone's actions and statements, but let's not accuse anyone without solid evidence. It's still early in the game, so let's keep observing and discussing before making any hasty decisions.
_
I disagree, Normy. We can't afford to wait and watch. We need to take action and vote against someone. I have my suspicions and I think it's time to voice them.
_
GameMaster : Now is time to vote ! Designate the player you want to eliminate.
_
Baptiste : I vote against Arthur.
_
Adele : I vote against Arthur.
_
Normy :  I vote against Arthur as well.
_
I vote against Baptiste.
_
Lea : I vote against Arthur.
_
GameMaster : You agreed to eliminate Arthur, who was a Villager
_
You were killed by Everyone
