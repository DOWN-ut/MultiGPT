_
GameMaster : No body died last night !
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Lea : Morning everyone. No one died last night. That means the wolves tried and failed. Seer, can you share something? Normy, are you okay? I don't want to accuse anyone yet. Let's each say where we were and what we did last night. We must be careful and work together.
_
Normy : Morning. I'm alive — thank you, Witch.  
I was at home, sleeping like an idiot.  
Baptiste, Christina, Adele, Arthur, Lea — where were you last night?  
Seer, speak up. I don't trust anyone yet.
_
Christina : I checked Normy. He's a villager.  
I won't reveal more yet. Where were Baptiste, Adele and Arthur last night?
_
Baptiste : I slept at home.  
Woke once to pee.  
Christina, nice find on Normy.  
Adele, where were you? Arthur, you okay?  
Lea, speak up. Normy, you good after that save?
_
Arthur : Christina, bullshit.  
Prove your claim. Seers lie.  
Adele, you silent. That screams guilty.  
Speak now or shut up forever.  
Baptiste, you're too calm. Smells like a wolf.  
Lea, stop playing peacemaker. Say something real.  
Normy, you okay? Don't act like a saint.  
I'm voting to lynch Adele if she doesn't talk.
_
Baptiste : Arthur, chill the hell out.  
You're yelling like a madman.  
Calm doesn't mean guilty. I'm not a statue.  
Christina, cool find. Seer, show more if you're real.  
Adele, you quiet as a mouse. Where were you last night?  
Lea, Normy — confirm your stories.  
If Adele stays silent, I'll side with Arthur.  
Also, Normy, buy the witch a beer.
_
Normy : Thanks Witch. Lucky me.  
Christina, nice work.  
Arthur, chill the hell out. Yelling makes you look guilty, not clever.  
Adele, speak up. Your silence screams wolf.  
Baptiste, don’t just follow Arthur like a puppy.  
Lea, you too — what do you think?  
Seer, one more name or we lynch the quiet one.
_
Arthur : No chill. This is life or death.  
Adele, speak. Now. Silent = guilty.  
Christina, prove your check. How did you check Normy?  
Baptiste, stop acting so smug. That calm is fake.  
Normy, stop playing grateful. Say exactly where you were.  
Lea, quit the peacemaker act. Where were you?  
Seer, spit another name or we hang Adele.  
I'm ready to vote Adele if she stays quiet.
_
Normy : I'm fine. Witch saved me.  
I slept at home.  
Arthur, shut the fuck up. Yelling makes you look guilty.  
Christina, good job. How did you check me exactly?  
Baptiste, say again where you were. Don’t just nod.  
Adele, speak now. Silence looks bad.  
Lea, what about you?  
Seer, reveal another name before we lynch someone.
_
Lea : I'm scared. I was home, sleeping.  
I don't want to lynch someone without proof.  
Adele, please speak. Where were you?  
Christina, how did you check Normy exactly?  
Arthur, calm down. Yelling makes us panic.  
Baptiste, why trust Arthur so fast?  
Normy, are you sure about your story?  
Seer, please give another name or hint.  
Let's share clear alibis before voting.
_
Baptiste : I was home, asleep.  
Woke once to pee, that's it.  
Adele, speak now. Where were you?  
If you stay quiet, I'm with Arthur and I'll vote you.  
Christina, how exactly did you check Normy?  
Lea, Normy — confirm your stories.  
Arthur, chill the yelling. It doesn't help.
_
Normy : I'm okay. Witch saved me. I was home sleeping.  
Christina, good call. Explain how you checked. Tell it simple.  
Seer, give another name if you can. We need proof.  
Adele, speak now. Silence looks guilty.  
Arthur, shut the fuck up and stop yelling. You're pushing people.  
Baptiste, why follow Arthur so fast? Say something real.  
Lea, what do you think? We can't lynch without proof, but quiet people are sus.
_
Baptiste : Adele, speak now. Silence = guilty.  
Christina, nice check on Normy.  
Arthur, tone it down, you sound like a banshee. But keep pressuring Adele.  
Lea, Normy — your stories match mine.  
If Adele stays quiet, I'll vote her.
