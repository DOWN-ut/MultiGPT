_
GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : No body died last night !
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Hey everyone! So, it seems like we had a quiet night without any deaths. That's a relief! But that also means we don't have any solid information about who could be a werewolf or not. 

Let's try to gather some information and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious during the night.
_
Normy : Yeah, it's strange that no one was killed. We should definitely be cautious and try to gather as much information as possible. Did anyone see or hear anything unusual during the night?
_
Christina : I didn't notice anything unusual during the night. It was quiet.
_
You know, sometimes the quiet nights are the most suspicious. It could mean that the werewolves are playing it safe and trying not to draw attention to themselves. We shouldn't let our guard down just because no one died. 

But hey, let's not jump to conclusions either. We should hear from everyone before making any assumptions.
_
Arthur : I vote against Christina. She was revealed by the Seer as a Werewolf. We should eliminate her to ensure our safety.
_
Lea : I understand your concern, Arthur, but accusing someone without concrete evidence can lead to innocent players being eliminated. Let's try to gather more information before making any hasty decisions. Does anyone else have any suspicions or observations from the night?
_
Adele : I don't have any suspicions or observations from the night. I didn't notice anything unusual.
_
Christina : I understand your concerns, Arthur, but I assure you, I am not a werewolf. I cannot control what the Seer saw, but I am innocent. We shouldn't jump to conclusions based solely on the Seer's revelation. Let's consider all the possibilities and gather more information before making any decisions.
_
Well, I gotta say, this situation is getting quite interesting. We have Arthur accusing Christina based on the Seer's revelation, and Christina denying the accusation. It's like a classic mystery novel!

But let's take a step back and think about it. Accusing someone solely based on the Seer's revelation can be risky, as it's possible that the Seer made a mistake or was deceived by someone. We should consider other factors and gather more information before deciding who to vote for.
