GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Christina : I think we should try to gather as much information as possible before making any decisions. We need to discuss and share our suspicions about who could be the werewolves.
_
I agree, Christina. It's important for us to share any suspicions or observations we have about the players. We need to work together to figure out who the werewolves might be.
_
Lea : I think it's important for us to approach this with an open mind. We shouldn't rush to accuse anyone without solid evidence. Let's listen to each other's opinions and consider all possibilities before making a decision.
_
Christina : I think Lea makes a valid point. Accusing someone without concrete evidence could lead to an innocent person being eliminated. We should be cautious and consider all possibilities before jumping to conclusions.
_
Absolutely, Christina. Accusing someone without evidence can have serious consequences. We should be careful not to let our emotions cloud our judgment. Let's gather more information and discuss any suspicious behavior or patterns we notice among the players.
_
Lea : I agree with both of you. It's important for us to have a constructive and open-minded discussion. Let's share any observations or suspicions we have, but let's also remember to treat each other with respect and not make any personal attacks. We're all here to have fun and figure out who the werewolves are.
_
Normy : I think it's important for us to keep an eye on each other's behavior. Sometimes, the smallest details can reveal a lot. Let's pay attention to any inconsistencies or unusual actions from the players. And remember, we don't want to jump to conclusions too quickly. Let's gather as much information as we can before making any decisions.
_
GameMaster : Now is time to vote ! Designate the player you want to eliminate.

I vote against Normy.
