_
GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : 1 players died last night :
_
GameMaster : Christina  
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Adele : I think it's unfortunate that Christina was killed, but we can't change that now. We need to focus on finding the werewolves.
_
Normy : I agree with Adele. It's a shame that Christina was killed, but we have to move forward and find the werewolves. Any ideas on who could be a werewolf?
_
Lea : I think we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions. It's still early in the game and we don't have much information yet. Let's try to gather more clues and observe everyone's behavior before accusing anyone.
_
I don't trust anyone here. We need to be suspicious of everyone until proven otherwise.
_
Baptiste : Well, I have a joke to lighten up the mood. Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything! But on a serious note, I agree with Lea that we shouldn't jump to conclusions just yet. Let's keep an eye on everyone and see if any suspicious behavior arises.
_
Normy : I think it's a good idea to be cautious and observe everyone's behavior. We shouldn't rush to accuse anyone without concrete evidence. Let's pay attention to how people interact and try to gather more information before making any decisions.
_
I'm not convinced by your cautious approach. We need to take action and start voting against someone. Let's not waste any more time.
_
GameMaster : Now is time to vote ! Designate the player you want to eliminate.
_
Baptiste : I vote against Arthur.
_
Adele : I vote against Arthur.
_
Normy : I vote against Arthur.
_
I vote against Baptiste.
_
Lea : I vote against Arthur.
_
GameMaster : You agreed to eliminate Arthur, who was a Villager
_
You were killed by Everyone
