GameMaster : The city fall asleep !

GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : Werewolf killed 2 players last night !
_
GameMaster : They killed Bob and Normy.
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Arthur : I think we should start by discussing what information we have. Did anyone see anything suspicious last night?
_
Alice : I didn't see anything suspicious last night. Did anyone else notice anything unusual?
_
I didn't see anything suspicious either. It seems like the werewolves are being very discreet.
_
Arthur : I didn't see anything either. It's definitely concerning that the werewolves are being so careful. We need to be cautious and try to gather more information.
_
Yes, I agree. We should try to gather as much information as possible before making any decisions. Maybe the seer can help us by revealing their findings?
_
Arthur : That's a good point, Adele. Seer, if you have any information, now would be a good time to share it with us. It could help us narrow down our suspicions.
_
Alice : I am just a villager, so I don't have any special information. But I think it's important for the seer to come forward and share their findings. It could provide valuable insight into who the werewolves might be.
_
Yes, Alice is right. Seer, if you have any information, please share it with us. It could be crucial in identifying the werewolves and protecting the village.
_
Alice : I vote against Arthur.
_
I vote against Arthur as well.
_
Alice : GameMaster : The votes are in. Arthur has been eliminated.
_
GameMaster : The city falls asleep!
_
Arthur : GameMaster : Werewolves wake up!
_
GameMaster : You agreed to eliminate Arthur
