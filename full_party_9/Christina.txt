GameMaster : The city wakes up ! This is the 1th day.
_
GameMaster : No body died last night !
_
GameMaster : Now is time to debate before voting for someone to kill.
_
Adele : Well, it seems like we had a quiet night with no deaths. That's...unexpected. But let's not celebrate just yet, there's still a chance the werewolves will strike tonight. We should remain cautious.

As for who we should vote to eliminate, I don't have any strong suspicions at the moment. I think it's important for us to hear from everyone before making a decision.
_
I agree with Adele. It's too early to point fingers without any solid evidence. Let's hear from everyone before we make any decisions.
_
Adele : I'm glad you agree, Christina. It's true that we shouldn't rush to accuse anyone without any solid evidence. We should take the time to listen to everyone's thoughts and observations before making a decision. It's important to consider all possibilities and gather as much information as we can.
_
Lea : I completely agree, Adele. It's crucial for us to approach this with an open mind and gather as much information as possible. Accusing someone without evidence could lead to the wrong person being eliminated. Let's give everyone a chance to speak and share their thoughts before making any decisions.
_
Normy : I've been thinking about it, and I have to say, I'm not really sure who to suspect at this point. It's still early in the game and we don't have much information to go on. I think it's important for us to listen to everyone's opinions and observations before making any decisions.
_
Adele : I agree with you, Normy. It's difficult to make any solid accusations without concrete evidence. We should encourage everyone to share their thoughts and observations so we can gather more information. Let's keep an open mind and consider all possibilities before making a decision.
_
Lea : I couldn't have said it better, Adele. We need to remain open-minded and consider all perspectives. Rushing to judgment without substantial evidence can lead to unintended consequences. Let's continue to listen to each other and gather more information before we decide who to vote for.
_
Normy : Yes, Lea, I completely agree. It's important for us to gather as much information as possible before making any decisions. We should encourage everyone to share their observations and suspicions so we can have a clearer picture of what's going on. Let's keep the conversation going and listen to each other's perspectives.
_
I think it's important for us to approach this logically and not let emotions cloud our judgment. We should focus on gathering evidence and listening to each other's observations before making any decisions.
